{Seeders are used to populate the database with initial data. Generate a seeder using the following command:}

Create your Express.js application in the main project file (e.g., index.js):

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set up middleware, routes, etc.

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
Integrate Sequelize in Express:
Inside your Express application, import Sequelize and your models to interact with the database. For example:
javascript
Copy code
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize(/* your database config */);

const User = sequelize.import('./models/User');

// Use your models to query the database
User.findAll().then(users => {
  console.log(users);
});

// Option 3: Passing parameters separately (other dialects)
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: /* one of 'mysql' | 'postgres' | 'sqlite' | 'mariadb' | 'mssql' | 'db2' | 'snowflake' | 'oracle' */
});

You can use the .authenticate() function to test if the connection is OK:

try {
  await sequelize.authenticate();
  console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', error);
}

Sequelize will keep the connection open by default, and use the same connection for all queries. If you need to close the connection, call sequelize.close() (which is asynchronous and returns a Promise).

NOTE
Once sequelize.close() has been called, it's impossible to open a new connection. You will need to create a new Sequelize instance to access your database again.
